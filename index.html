					<p>Blackpink (Hangul: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their first number-one hits on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.</p>
					<p>Blackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first girl group, 2NE1, in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was similar to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie calling it "more strict than school" and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For members who had left behind life outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was tough. Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011 when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14, 2011 that the label's new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 featuring at least seven members. From then, there were numerous news and rumors surrounding the new girl group about their debut being delayed but there was no official information. It was only until May 18, 2016 that YG Entertainment confirmed the new girl group, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition and confirming that the debut would be in July.</p>
					<p>On June 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that the new girl group includes four members instead of the original plan of having nine members, and revealed Blackpink as the group's official name. According to a representative, Blackpink meant "pretty isn't everything" and symbolized that "they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent." Jisoo later disclosed in a press conference that they almost debuted as 'Pink Punk', 'Baby Monster' or 'Magnum'. Blackpink released their first dance practice video on July 6 to great attention from viewers. On July 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that Blackpink's debut would be on August 8, 2016</p>
